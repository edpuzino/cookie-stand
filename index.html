                <p>         Pat Pruit grew up in Alaska in the same village that his family lived in for many generations.  When he was just a boy he would stay back with his grandmother when the men would go out to hunt. He learned a lot from his grandmother but he was eager to join the men on their hunts. When he was a young man he quikly learned to hunt and fish like all of the young men in his village.  When Pat was in his twenties he moved to Seattle wher he worked as a fisherman.  He soon met Samantha who he soon married.  They had two children Peter and Claire.  Pat missed the small village where he grew up and wished that his children could grow up as he did.  When Pat would tell his children about his childhood he especially loved telling them about his grandmother and how he would love cooking with her.  This eventually led to Pat cooking many of his grandmother's traditional dishes.  Pat's children and his wife especially loved his salmon cookies.</p>
                <p>      Pat's salmon cookies soon became very popular with his friends and his childrens friends as well.  Pat eventually came up with the Idea of satarting a bakery so that he could spend more time with his family and his children could eventually help him  in the store if they wanted when they got older.  Pat's opened his first store at First and Pike.  Pat's Salmon Cookies soon became very popular with the locals as well as tourists visiting Seattle.  It wasn't long before pat started opening other stores around the city.  Presently there are five Pat's Salmon Cookies stores and Pat has plans on expanding further.  Pat and his family are very greatful to the great people of Seattle and to all of their customers, but he is especially happy that everyone loves his grandmother's recipe.</p>
